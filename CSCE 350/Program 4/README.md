# CSCE 350 Project 3 

### This project required us to do a few different things. First was checking a vector of type string for anagrams using three methods:
1.) Using our own comparison method.
2.) Using a self-balancing binary search tree (std::map).
3.) Using a hashmap (std::unordered_map).

### Along with this, we were also needed to implement Warshall's and Floyd's algorithms in Graph.h
