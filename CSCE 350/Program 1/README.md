# CSCE 350 Project 1

### This project required us to code heapsort and an anagram checker in algs.h as well as three algorithms in tree.h: num_nodes (returns the number of nodes in a tree), has_duplicate_val (determines whether the tree contains duplicates), and trees_identical (determines whether the tree is identical to another tree).
